A Document provides a .get method to retrieve properties, and a .set to set them - as well as other utility methods depending on its type. All root documents are Object Entities, which also provide .update. Since Documents can contain arbitrary sub-objects, you can retrieve lists off them, which comes as List Entities and provide some common list methods too.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"local-storage/files":{"id":"local-storage/files","title":"File storage","description":"To work with files in lo-fi, you add a file type field to a document.
